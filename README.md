# 🌐 CDP — Career Development Platform

> A fully responsive and dynamic web platform designed to accelerate your learning in tech — from DSA to Cybersecurity, UI/UX to Full-Stack Web Development.

## 🎓 Mission Statement
**CDP (Career Development Platform)** was built with a single mission:
To empower college students with free, structured, and high-quality access to tech skills — especially those who can’t afford costly courses or lack clear direction.

It’s more than a platform — it’s a movement to eliminate confusion, reduce inequality, and help every peer rise in tech with clarity and confidence.
**CDP is built for every student who ever asked, ‘Where do I even start?’**

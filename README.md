# Pavan Lingam - Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. It is a fully responsive, single-page application (SPA) designed to showcase my skills, projects, certifications, and professional experience as a Software Developer and Content Creator.

The site is built with a modern, glassmorphism-inspired UI and features dynamic content rendering, a dark/light mode toggle, and animated elements.

## ✨ Features

  * **Single Page Application (SPA):** All sections load instantly without a page refresh for a smooth, app-like user experience.
  * **Dark/Light Mode:** A sleek, animated toggle switches the entire site's color palette, with the user's preference saved.
  * **Responsive Glassmorphism UI:** A modern, transparent card design that is fully responsive and looks great on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
  * **Dynamic Sections:**
      * **About:** A comprehensive overview, a "Download Resume" link, and a vertical timeline for Education and Experience.
      * **Projects:** Project cards are dynamically generated from a JavaScript object.
      * **Certifications:** An image-based gallery of certifications that open in a full-screen modal pop-up when clicked.
      * **Content Creation:** A dedicated section for the `@filmedby.pavanreddy` brand, featuring animated statistics, a seamless-looping image carousel, and UI simulations.
      * **Services:** An announcement box for the O2O.agency and a list of offered services.

## 💻 Tech Stack

This project was built from scratch using:

  * **HTML5:** For the core structure and content.
  * **CSS3:** For all custom styling, including glassmorphism, animations, and the responsive layout (using Flexbox and Grid).
  * **JavaScript (ES6+):** For all interactivity, including the SPA routing, dynamic content rendering (for projects, certs, etc.), modal pop-ups, and theme toggling.
  * **Bootstrap 4:** Utilized for its grid system and core components (like the modal and navbar).
  * **Font Awesome:** For icons used throughout the application.
